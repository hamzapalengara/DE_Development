DE_Development (Local)

Learning objective

This project is a safe practice ground to learn data engineering by doing, before you move to the cloud. The focus is to experience the rhythm of real pipelines: land raw data, preserve lineage, clean and shape it, and deliver something trustworthy—end to end—on your laptop.

What you will internalize here
- How layered data flows simplify thinking and reduce risk.
- How to introduce simple, repeatable habits (configs, audit columns, validations) that scale.
- How to keep work reproducible and explainable so you can debug with confidence.
- How to keep local development close to production ideas without the cloud overhead.

Mindset to practice
- Make small steps visible. Validate often.
- Prefer boring, reliable patterns over clever one‑offs.
- Aim for clarity you can teach to others.
